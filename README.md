# 💎 FinAgent Pro: Multi-Agent AI Financial Analyst

An institutional-grade, AI-powered equity intelligence platform that leverages a multi-agent AI system to fetch, analyze, and report on real-time stock market data in seconds.

## 📋 Overview

FinAgent Pro transforms complex financial research into a seamless experience. By utilizing **CrewAI** and the lightning-fast **Groq** inference engine (Llama 3.1), the platform orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents. You simply type a natural language query (e.g., *"Analyze Tesla's performance last month"*), and the AI automatically fetches ticker data, scrapes the latest news, analyzes market sentiment, and synthesizes an actionable financial report.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Multi-Agent AI Architecture
* **Research Agent** - Autonomously figures out the correct stock ticker, normalizes the timeframe, and scrapes Yahoo Finance for exact pricing and headlines.
* **Analysis Agent** - Ingests the raw data to calculate volatility, identify trends, gauge news sentiment, and formulate a one-line institutional strategy.
* **Orchestrator Agent** - Synthesizes all findings into a concise, professional final report.

### 📈 Real-Time Market Intelligence
* **Live Financial Data** - Extracts live pricing, Revenue, EPS, P/E Ratios, and Market Cap using the `yfinance` API.
* **Automated News Scraping** - Uses `BeautifulSoup` to bypass standard blocks and scrape the top 3 real-time headlines for your requested stock.
* **Dynamic Timeframes** - Understands natural language periods (e.g., "last week", "ytd", "6 months") and converts them into valid financial data queries.

### 🎨 Premium UI/UX
* **Modern Dashboard** - Built with a custom-styled Streamlit interface featuring a sleek Purple/Teal gradient theme.
* **Interactive Metric Cards** - Automatically color-coded (Green/Red) KPI cards for quick visual analysis of price changes and trends.
* **Transparent Agent Logging** - View the raw "thought process" and outputs of each individual AI agent in a beautifully formatted report box.
